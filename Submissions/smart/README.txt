I used the following code examples / tutorials / stack overflow questions to help me complete this assignment:

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21842384/importing-data-from-multiple-csv-files-in-d3
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34888205/insert-padding-so-that-points-do-not-overlap-with-y-or-x-axis

- https://bl.ocks.org/ctufts/298bfe4b11989960eeeecc9394e9f118

I did not copy and paste any of the above code, but used it as a reference to help me understand d3 syntax and functionality.
